# Open positions

### PhD positions

**The Music, Audio, and AI Lab (AMAAI) at SUTD invites applications for a PhD position in the exciting and rapidly evolving field of music and audio artificial intelligence.**

The AMAAI lab, led by Prof. Dorien Herremans, is engaged in cutting-edge research at the intersection of music, audio, and artificial intelligence. We are based in tropical Singapore, a hub for AI research and startups, but also a great base to explore South East Asia, where English is the first language. Our PhD students and PostDoc researchers work on projects that explore areas such as:

<ul>
  <li>Generative Music AI: we recently developed Mustango text-to-music, as well as a range of other controllable generative midi models.</li>
  <li>Music Information Retrieval: emotion prediction models, hit prediction, similarity detection, etc.</li>
  <li>AI Music Production</li>
  <li>Affective Computing for Music</li>
</ul>

The ideal candidate will possess:
- A strong academic background in computer science, electrical engineering, music information retrieval, or a related field.</li>
- A demonstrated passion for music and a keen interest in artificial intelligence.</li>
- Excellent programming skills and experience with relevant machine learning libraries (PyTorch etc).</li>
- The ability to work independently while also thriving in a collaborative research environment.</li>
- Strong communication and writing skills.</li>
- The ability to focus and persevere/problem solve for a task</li>
