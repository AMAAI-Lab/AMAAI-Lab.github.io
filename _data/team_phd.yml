  bio: "Kyra is a PhD student in Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), under the supervision of Assistant Professor Dorien Herremans. She received her Bachelor of Engineering (Artificial Intelligence Specialization Track) from SUTD. Kyra's research interests focus around affective computing, neurotechnology and human-computer interaction. She believes that there is an ethical need to challenge the idea that the human condition is fundamentally unalterable, and that through the liberation and empowerment of marginalized groups using technology, we can create not only a more equal world, but a more equitable one."

  bio: "Perry is a PhD student at SUTD who returned after graduating with a BSc in 2015. He is interested in psychology and linguistics, but still being funded to do AI and machine learning. This is why he is researching ways to reduce model training for speech synthesis and prosody variation, which lets him pretend to be a (non-qualified) linguist in the process."

  bio: "Nizam Kadir is a Doctoral Researcher at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), under the Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) pillar, supervised by Assistant Professor Dorien Herremans and Dr Nachamma Sockalingam. His research focuses on LLM-enabled adaptive learning, exploring how ensembles of specialised Large Language Model (LLM) agents—such as TutorBot, ScaffoldBot, and FeedbackBot—can be orchestrated in real time to personalise learning with transparency, accuracy, and ethical safeguards. He is the developer of LearnAdapt, an AI-powered adaptive learning platform that operationalises this Ensemble of Specialised LLMs (ES-LLMs) vision in authentic educational contexts, fostering collaboration between researchers and practitioners. His broader research interest lies in modelling pedagogical intelligence in machines—how computational architectures can embody and enact pedagogical intent. With over two decades of experience across education and technology, Nizam brings together expertise in EdTech innovation, full-stack development, MLOps, and design-based research. Before his PhD, he led large-scale education initiatives in the private sector and the Ministry of Education, Singapore, focusing on personalised learning and AI-driven instructional design. He holds a Master of Science in Genome Sciences from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and a Postgraduate Diploma in Education (Learning Sciences) from the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore."
