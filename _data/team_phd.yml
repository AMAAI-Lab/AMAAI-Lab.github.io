  bio: "Perry is a PhD student at SUTD who returned after graduating with a BSc in 2015. He is interested in psychology and linguistics, but still being funded to do AI and machine learning. This is why he is researching ways to reduce model training for speech synthesis and prosody variation, which lets him pretend to be a (non-qualified) linguist in the process."
