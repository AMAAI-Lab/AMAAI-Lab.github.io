  bio: "Lena is currently an interdisciplinary PhD student in the Music Perception and Cognition Lab at McGill University, under the supervision of Prof. Stephen McAdams. Their research interests are in the area of timbre perception, music hermeneutics, cognitive representation, and emotion perception in music. As a professional performer in a contemporary Chinese chamber music ensemble (Ding Yi Music Company), and a part-time lecturer in the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, they are particularly keen on integrating their research interests with performance. Their work on this aspect has earned them the Research Alive award from McGill Schulich School of Music in 2018/19. Conference presentations: SMPC 2019; ICTM 2015. Book chapters: 'Singaporean Performance’ in Singapore’s Chinese orchestral practice: What is it? Where is it? (in print); Negotiating a Sound: Ding Yi Music Company and Contemporary Chinese Chamber Ensembles (in print)."
