  bio: "Natalie got her PhD at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) in 2018. She graduated from SUTD in 2015 and received her B. Eng in Information Systems (Robotics). Her research interest includes psyhoacoustics, audio information retrieval, and room acoustic simulations. She also enjoys teaching undergraduate courses involving machine learning algorithms and audio signal processing. Her work focused on developing new and fast geometrical acoustic algorithms for binaural room simulations. In particular, methods that minimise computational cost while maintaining perceptual plausibility. Suitable areas for application include music and film production, virtual reality, and gaming. Natalie is currently a Lecturer at SUTD."
